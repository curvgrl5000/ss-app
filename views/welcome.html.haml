                        In 2002 we developed the Vantage Success Factors framework to help simplify finding an alignment
                        between our client companies and top candidates. Vantage Success Factors drive the match between the corporate culture,
                        people and goals of our client companies; and the competencies, passions, personalities and career objectives of impact players.
                        The Success Factors framework has worked so well, it has cut the average length of a search by 25 days -- all the while keeping the 
                        key stakeholders on the same page.
