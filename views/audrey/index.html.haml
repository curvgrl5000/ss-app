              "We retained Vantage Partners for a critical Vice President search that had a very high bar and, heretofore, had been extremely difficult to find.  
              In record time and with incredible attention to detail regarding our needs for the right Executive, Audrey Shuster and Gene Zaccor brought us the talent, quality and experience that we were looking for in our VP of Media Consulting.  I highly recommend Audrey and Gene - The Vantage Partners Team -  for key executive hires, particularly those with a high bar and critical time needs."
